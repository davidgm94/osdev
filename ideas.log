[PRINTF]

* Allow random byte number for the format specifier: 0 <= i <= 64 | i == format specifier number (round up to the nearest greater type size). This also can be used for floats. Proposed format specifier for string: "%*c"

[INTERRUPTS, STACKTRACE]
* Switch to ASM interrupt handling instead of GCC attribute (might be causing stack corruption)
